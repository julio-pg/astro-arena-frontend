   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://your-backend-url
   VITE_DEFAULT_PLAYER=your-default-player
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

---

## Running the Application

- Start the development server:
  ```bash
  pnpm run dev
  ```
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1214`.

## Webhooks and Backend Interaction

The frontend communicates with the NestJS backend using **webhooks** for real-time updates. Key interactions include:

- Fetching card data and player stats.
- Sending battle moves and receiving results.
- Updating the game state dynamically.

Ensure the backend is running and the webhook URLs are correctly configured in the `.env` file.

## AI Model for PC Player

The PC player is powered by an AI model that simulates human-like decision-making during battles. The model is trained to:

- Analyze the game state.
- Predict optimal moves based on card attributes and game rules.
- Adapt to different player strategies.

The AI model is hosted in the backend and integrated into the frontend via webhook calls.
